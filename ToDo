1- For SA for P and SA for R: Robustness evaluator and P evaluator should be kept in SA Manager with original constraints.

2- For SA micro and normal: Both robustness and penalty values should be kept up to date as in Crossover Base.

3- During SA micro or normal: if equal, accept if it does not worsen the other objective

4- Should CX maintain feasibillity??? TRY!
